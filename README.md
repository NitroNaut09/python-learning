## Background
I want to learn Python, and Linux, and later get a job as a DevOps/ML/DL/MLOps Engineer. I recently followed this great Python tutorial by Mosh Hamedani, which is 6 hours long and contains everything basic you need to know about Python.  (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)

## What is this repo?
> This repository is just a digital space to hold all the basic code I've learned and copied from the video. So, if you want to refresh your memory on Python without watching the whole video again, just read the **collection.py**! <
